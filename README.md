# datamanagement-couse
project I did on Datamanagement lecture at SNU
on part1(), I was required to make a new table called mentor and add mentor data to it through python.
Next, I used nested query to extract data that satisfy the requirements below.
- mentor's id, pro_mentor (whether the mentor is pro_mentor or not), age, have_introduction, have_field, num_of_answers, avg_of_answer_score, avg_of_answer_body, num_of_groups, avg_of_group_members, num_of_emails, num_of_tags 
on the next step, I was required to make a decision tree based on Node impurity method by calculating gini and entropy.
